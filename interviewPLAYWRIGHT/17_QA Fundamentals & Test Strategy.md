👉 This is **VERY IMPORTANT (Manager-level + SDET interviews 🔥💯)**

***

# ✅ Q1. How do you define a test strategy for a new product?

### 🟢 CONCEPT (Telugu)

* What to test ✅
* How to test ✅
* Risk-based approach

***

### 🎯 INTERVIEW STRATEGY (English)

👉 Start with:

* risk-based approach ✅  
  👉 then:
* test types
* environments

***

### ✅ English Answer

“I define a test strategy by identifying high-risk areas, selecting test types, defining environments, and setting entry and exit criteria.  
I focus more effort on high-risk and business-critical features.”

***

### ✅ Telugu Answer

“Test strategyలో first risk identify చేసి high priority areas మీద focus చేస్తాను. తర్వాత test types, environments define చేస్తాము.”

***

### 🔥 Real-time Example

“Payment moduleకి ఎక్కువ test coverage ఇచ్చాము ఎందుకంటే అది high-risk feature.”

***

### 💻 Code (conceptual tagging)

```ts
test('@payment @critical checkout flow', async () => {});
```

***

# ✅ Q2. Verification vs Validation?

### 🟢 CONCEPT (Telugu)

* Verification → spec check ✅
* Validation → user needs

***

### 🎯 STRATEGY

👉 Say:

* both important ✅

***

### ✅ English Answer

“Verification ensures we are building the product correctly according to specifications, while validation ensures we are building the right product for user needs.”

***

### ✅ Telugu Answer

“Verificationలో spec correctగా follow అయ్యిందో check చేస్తాం. Validationలో user needs fulfill అవుతుందో check చేస్తాం.”

***

### 🔥 Real-time Example

“Feature spec correctగా ఉంది కానీ userకి confuse అయ్యింది → validation failure.”

***

### 💻 Code

```ts
// verification test
await expect(page).toHaveURL('/dashboard');
```

***

# ✅ Q3. How do you measure test coverage?

### 🟢 CONCEPT (Telugu)

* Requirement coverage ✅
* Risk coverage

***

### 🎯 STRATEGY

👉 Say:

* tags usage ✅
* tracking

***

### ✅ English Answer

“I measure test coverage using requirement traceability, mapping tests to user stories and ensuring all critical requirements are covered.”

***

### ✅ Telugu Answer

“Test coverage measure చేయడానికి requirement tagging use చేస్తాను.”

***

### 🔥 Real-time Example

“Missing requirementకి test లేదని identify చేశాను.”

***

### 💻 Code

```ts
test('@REQ-101 login test', async () => {});
```

***

# ✅ Q4. What is shift-left testing?

### 🟢 CONCEPT (Telugu)

Testing early stageలో ✅

***

### 🎯 STRATEGY

👉 Say:

* early defect detection ✅

***

### ✅ English Answer

“Shift-left testing means moving testing activities earlier in the development lifecycle to catch defects early and reduce cost.”

***

### ✅ Telugu Answer

“Shift-left అంటే development ప్రారంభంలోనే testing start చేయడం.”

***

### 🔥 Real-time Example

“Development ముందు test cases define చేయడం వల్ల bugs reduce అయ్యాయి.”

***

### 💻 Code

```ts
// test written before feature complete
test('login validation', async () => {});
```

***

# ✅ Q5. Regression testing in Agile?

### 🟢 CONCEPT (Telugu)

Different levels ✅

***

### 🎯 STRATEGY

👉 Say:

* smoke + regression ✅

***

### ✅ English Answer

“I follow a tiered regression strategy with smoke tests for PRs, targeted regression for sprints, and full regression for releases.”

***

### ✅ Telugu Answer

“Agileలో smoke tests PRలో, full regression releaseలో run చేస్తాము.”

***

### 🔥 Real-time Example

“PRలో 3 min smoke tests run చేసి quick feedback ఇచ్చాము.”

***

### 💻 Code

```bash
npx playwright test --grep @smoke
```

# 🌟 ✅ ✅ PERFECT 2–5 MIN PROJECT ANSWER (REAL EXPERIENCE STYLE 🔥🔥🔥)

### 🎯 English (HIGH IMPACT ANSWER)

“In my project, I followed a structured test strategy to ensure quality and efficiency.

I started with risk assessment, identifying critical areas like authentication and payment.  
These high-risk areas received maximum test coverage, while low-risk areas had minimal testing.

I defined different test types such as functional, regression, API, and UI tests, and aligned them with the test pyramid for better performance.

For coverage, I used requirement traceability by tagging tests with requirement IDs, which helped track coverage and identify gaps.

I also implemented shift-left testing by writing test cases before development started.  
This helped developers understand requirements clearly and reduced defects early in the lifecycle.

In Agile, I followed a tiered regression strategy: smoke tests for PR validation, targeted regression for specific features, and full regression for release builds.

Overall, this approach improved test efficiency, reduced defects, and ensured faster delivery with high quality.”

***

### 🎯 Telugu Version (Simple + Natural)

“నా projectలో structured test strategy follow చేశాను.

First risk identify చేసి critical areas మీద focus చేశాను, ముఖ్యంగా login మరియు payment modules.

Different test types define చేసి test pyramid follow చేశాను.

Requirement tagging ద్వారా coverage track చేశాను.

Shift-left approach use చేసి development ముందే test cases prepare చేశాను.

Agileలో smoke tests PRలో, full regression releaseలో run అయ్యేలాగా setup చేశాను.

Overallగా bugs reduce అయ్యాయి మరియు quality improve అయింది.”
